# Windows / WSL2 Installation Notes

To install this stack on a Windows/WSL2-based Ubuntu VM, there are a few extra manual steps, roughly outlined here:

* Copy the fonts in an explorer window from `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\mitch\.fonts` (change home directory as needed) to a local directory on the desktop, right click all those fonts, and select `Install`. I suggest the normal, italic, and bold versions, both regular and Mono variants. The Mono variants appear smaller in the console - not sure what other difference there is between the two.
* You might want to also update the starting location for the Ubuntu shell in the Windows Terminal preferences.
